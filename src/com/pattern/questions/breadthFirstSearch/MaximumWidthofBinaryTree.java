/**
 * Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum width of the given tree.
 * <p>
 * The maximum width of a tree is the maximum width among all levels.
 * <p>
 * The width of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the leftmost and rightmost non-null nodes),
 * where the null nodes between the end-nodes that would be present in a complete binary tree extending down to that
 * level are also counted into the length calculation.
 * <p>
 * It is guaranteed that the answer will in the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: root = [1,3,2,5,3,null,9] Output: 4 Explanation: The maximum width exists in the third level with length 4
 * (5,3,null,9).
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: root = [1,3,2,5,null,null,9,6,null,7] Output: 7 Explanation: The maximum width exists in the fourth level with
 * length 7 (6,null,null,null,null,null,7).
 * <p>
 * Example 3:
 * <p>
 * Input: root = [1,3,2,5] Output: 2 Explanation: The maximum width exists in the second level with length 2 (3,2).
