/*
* ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement Summary

Given a string s, return the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in the string.
* The two substrings must not overlap (though they can share characters), and you only need to find the length of the longest repeating substring.
ðŸ”¹ Examples

Example 1:
Input: s = "abcd"
Output: 0
Explanation: No repeating substring.

Example 2:
Input: s = "abbaba"
Output: 2
Explanation: The substring "ab" appears more than once.

Example 3:
Input: s = "aabcaabdaab"
Output: 3
Explanation: The substring "aab" appears at least twice.

* Find the maximum length L such that there exists a substring of length L that occurs at least twice in s.
