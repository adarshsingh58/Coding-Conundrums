Common Logical Reasoning-Based Problems (Not Data Structure Dependent)
ðŸ§  1. Longest Increasing Subsequence

    Recognizing pattern of subsequence growth.

    Can be solved via DP or with a binary search trick (O(n log n)).

ðŸ§  2. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (All Variants)

    Track min/max values dynamically.

    Use greedy or prefix concepts.

ðŸ§  3. Jump Game / Jump Game II

    Think greedily or via DP.

    Requires reachability logic, not any data structure.

ðŸ§  4. Climbing Stairs / Fibonacci Variants

    Pure recurrence relation.

    Classic DP base problem.

ðŸ§  5. Coin Change / Coin Change II

    Requires counting ways or minimizing coins.

    Needs recursion/memoization logic.

ðŸ§  6. Partition Equal Subset Sum

    Subset sum with DP.

    Uses 2D/1D table logic, not tree/heap/map.

ðŸ§  7. Decode Ways (A â†’ Z Encoding)

    Recursive + state transitions.

    Focus is on valid transitions, not storage.

ðŸ§  8. House Robber / House Robber II

    Avoid adjacent elements.

    Linear DP with skip logic.

ðŸ§  9. Trapping Rain Water

    Use two-pointer logic or precomputed arrays.

    Involves local/global max reasoning.

ðŸ§  10. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

    Core is in state tracking with window mechanics.

    Often optimized with simple map, but main work is logical flow.

ðŸ”„ Miscellaneous Logical Challenges

Gas Station	Circular greedy check
Add Binary / Multiply Strings	Manual simulation
Excel Sheet Column Title / Number	Base conversion
Integer to Roman	Pattern mapping
Valid Parentheses String with Wildcards	Range-based logic
âœ… Common Traits of These Problems

    Require step-by-step simulation or tracking state over time.

    DP or greedy rather than tree/graph traversal.

    Little to no need for HashMaps, Stacks, or Queues.
