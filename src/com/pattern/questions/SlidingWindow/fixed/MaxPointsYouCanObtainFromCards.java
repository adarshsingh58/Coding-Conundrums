/**
 * Given an array of integers representing the value of cards,
 * write a function to calculate the maximum score you can achieve by selecting
 * exactly k cards from either the beginning or the end of the array.
 *
 * For example, if k = 3, then you have the option to select:
 *     the first three cards,
 *     the last three cards,
 *     the first card and the last two cards
 *     the first two cards and the last card
 *
 * Example 1: Input:
 * cards = [2,11,4,5,3,9,2]
 * k = 3
 * Output:
 * 17
 *
 * Explanation:
 *     Selecting the first three cards from the beginning (2 + 11 + 4) gives a total of 17.
 *     Selecting the last three cards (3 + 9 + 2) gives a total of 14.
 *     Selecting the first card and the last two cards (2 + 9 + 2) gives a total of 13.
 *     Selecting the first two cards and the last card (2 + 11 + 2) gives a total of 15.
 *
 * So the maximum score is 17.
