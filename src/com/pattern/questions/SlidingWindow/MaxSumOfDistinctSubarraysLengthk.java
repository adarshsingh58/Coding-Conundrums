/**
 * DESCRIPTION (credit Leetcode.com)
 *
 * Given an integer array nums and an integer k, write a function to identify the highest possible sum of a subarray within nums, where the subarray meets the following criteria: its length is k, and all of its elements are unique.
 * EXAMPLES
 *
 * Example 1: Input:
 *
 * nums = [3, 2, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 7, -1]
 * k = 4
 *
 * Output:
 *
 * 20
 *
 * Explanation: The subarrays of nums with length 4 are:
 *
 * [3, 2, 2, 3] # elements 3 and 2 are repeated.
 * [2, 2, 3, 4] # element 2 is repeated.
 * [2, 3, 4, 6] # meets the requirements and has a sum of 15.
 * [3, 4, 6, 7] # meets the requirements and has a sum of 20.
 * [4, 6, 7, 7] # element 7 is repeated.
 * [6, 7, 7, -1] # element 7 is repeated.
 *
 * We return 20 because it is the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays that meet the conditions.
