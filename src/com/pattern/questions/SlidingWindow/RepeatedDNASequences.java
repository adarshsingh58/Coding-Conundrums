/**
 * Given a string, dna, that represents a DNA subsequence, and a number kk, return all the contiguous subsequences (substrings) of length kk that occur more than once in the string. The order of the returned subsequences does not matter. If no repeated substring is found, the function should return an empty set.
 * <p>
 * The DNA sequence is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as AA, CC, GG, and TT. For example, ACGAATTCCGACGAATTCCG is a DNA sequence. When studying DNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences in it.
 *
 *
 * eg:
 * dna: gagtcacagtagtttca k=3
 * there are 2 sequences agt(3 times) and tca(2 times)
 * op: agt and tca
