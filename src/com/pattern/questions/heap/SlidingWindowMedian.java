 * Given an integer array, nums, and an integer, k, there is a sliding window of size k, which is moving from the very left to the very right of the array. We can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

 * Given this scenario, return the median of the each window. Answers within 10−510−5 of the actual value will be accepted.
