/**
 * Create a data structure that can store a list of integers that can change in size over time and find the median from this dynamically growing list in constant time, O(1)O(1).
 * <p>
 * Implement a class, MedianOfStream, which should support the following operations:
 * <p>
 * Constructor(): This initializes the object of this class, which in turn creates the max and the min heap.
 * <p>
 * Insert Num(num): This adds an integer, num, to the data structure.
 * <p>
 * Find Median(): This finds the median of all elements seen so far. If there are an even number of elements, return the average of the two middle values.
