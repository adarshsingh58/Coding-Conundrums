/**
 * You are given an array of intervals where each interval is represented by a pair [starti,endi][starti​,endi​]. The startistarti​ values are unique, meaning no two intervals begin at the same time.
 * <p>
 * The task is to find the right interval for each interval in the list. The right interval for an interval ii is an interval jj such that startj>=endistartj​>=endi​ and startjstartj​ is minimized (i.e., it is the smallest start time among all valid intervals that is greater than or equal to endiendi​). Note that ii may equal jj.
 * <p>
 * Return an array of right interval indexes for each interval ii. If no right interval exists for interval ii, then put −1−1 at index ii.
