/**
 * We are given an array of closed intervals
 * <p>
 * , intervals, where each interval has a start time and an end time. The input array is sorted with respect to the start times of each interval. For example, intervals = [ [1,4], [3,6], [7,9] ][ [1,4], [3,6], [7,9] ] is sorted in terms of start times 1, 31, 3, and 77.
 * <p>
 * Your task is to merge the overlapping intervals and return a new output array consisting of only the non-overlapping intervals.
 * eg: intervals: 1,5  3,7  4,6  6,8
 * op: 1,8
