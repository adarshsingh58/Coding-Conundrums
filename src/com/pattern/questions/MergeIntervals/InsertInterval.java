 * Given a sorted list of nonoverlapping intervals and a new interval, your task is to insert

 * intervals remains sorted and nonoverlapping. Each interval is a pair of nonnegative numbers,
 * the first being the start time and the second being the end time of the interval.
eg:
 interbals 1,3  5,7  8,9  10,13
 new interval 2,6
