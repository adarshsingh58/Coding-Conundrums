/**
 * Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of intervals you
 * need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
 * <p>
 * Note that intervals which only touch at a point are non-overlapping. For example, [1, 2] and [2, 3] are
 * non-overlapping.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]] Output: 1 Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the
 * intervals are non-overlapping.
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]] Output: 2 Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the
 * intervals non-overlapping.
 * <p>
 * Example 3:
 * <p>
 * Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]] Output: 0 Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're
 * already non-overlapping.
