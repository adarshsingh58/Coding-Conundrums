/**
 * A binary watch has 4 LEDs for displaying hours (ranging from 0 to 11) and 6 for displaying minutes (ranging from 0 to
 * 59). Each LED can be on (1) or off (0), with the least significant bit on the right. For example, the binary watch
 * below reads “9:22.”
 * <p>
 * Given an integer enabled, which represents the number of LEDs currently turned on, return all possible times that the
 * watch could display. You may return the answer in any order.
 * <p>
 * Note: Remember the following regarding leading zeros:
 * <p>
 * The hour cannot have a leading zero (e.g., “01:00” is invalid, it should be “1:00”).
 * <p>
 * The minute must be two digits and may include a leading zero (e.g., “10:2” is invalid, it should be “10:02”).
