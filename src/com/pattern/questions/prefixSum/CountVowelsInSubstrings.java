package com.pattern.questions.prefixSum;
/**
 * DESCRIPTION
 *
 * Write a function to efficiently count vowels within specified substrings of a given string.
 *
 * The substrings will be given to you a list queries of [left, right] pairs, which correspond to the substring word[left:right + 1] in Python.
 *
 * The function should return a list of integers, where each integer represents the vowel count for the corresponding query. You can assume the input string will only contain lowercase letters.
 *
 * Your function should be optimized to run efficiently for a large number of queries.
 * EXAMPLES
 *
 * Input:
 *
 * word = "prefixsum"
 * queries = [[0, 2], [1, 4], [3, 5]]
 *
 * Output: [1, 2, 1]
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 * word[0:3] -> "pre" contains 1 vowels
 * word[1:5]-> "refi" contains 2 vowels
 * word[3:6]-> "fix" contains 1 vowels
