/**
 * Write an algorithm to determine if a number nn is a happy number.
 * <p>
 * We use the following process to check if a given number is a happy number:
 * <p>
 * Starting with the given number nn, replace the number with the sum of the squares of its digits.
 * Repeat the process until:
 * The number equals 11, which will depict that the given number nn is a happy number.
 * The number enters a cycle, which will depict that the given number nn is not a happy number.
 * <p>
 * Return TRUE if nn is a happy number, and FALSE if not.
 *
 * eg: n=23
 * op: true ->
 * 2sq + 3sq= 13
 * 1sq + 3sq=10
 * 1sq + 0sq = 1
 * hence true
