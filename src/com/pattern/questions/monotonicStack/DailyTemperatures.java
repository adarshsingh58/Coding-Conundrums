/**
 * Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer[i]
 * is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for
 * which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.
 * <p>

 * Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73] Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: temperatures = [30,40,50,60] Output: [1,1,1,0]
