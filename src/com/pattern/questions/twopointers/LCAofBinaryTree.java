 * You are given two nodes, p and q. The task is to return their lowest common ancestor (LCA).
 * Both nodes have a reference to their parent node. The tree’s root is not provided;
 * you must use the parent pointers to find the nodes’ common ancestor.
 * <p>
 * Note: The lowest common ancestor of two nodes, p and q, is the lowest node in the binary tree, with both p and q as descendants.
 * <p>
 * In a tree, a descendant of a node is any node reachable by following edges downward from that node, including the node itself.
