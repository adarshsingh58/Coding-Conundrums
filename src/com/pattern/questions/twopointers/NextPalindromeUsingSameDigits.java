/**
 * Given a string num_str representing a palindrome, the string only contains digits.
 * Your task is to return the next possible palindrome using the same digits.
 * The returned palindrome would be the next largest palindrome, meaning there can be more than one way to rearrange
 * the digits to make a larger palindrome. Return an empty string if no greater palindrome can be made.
 * <p>
 * Consider the following example to understand the expected output for a given numeric string:
 * <p>
 * input string = "123321"
 * <p>
 * possible palindromes = "213312", "231132", "312213", "132231", "321123"
 * <p>
 * We should return the palindrome "132231" as it is greater than "123321" yet the smallest palindrome
 *
 * excluding the original palindrome.
