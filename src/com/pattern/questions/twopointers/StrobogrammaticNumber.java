 * Given a string num representing an integer, determine whether it is a strobogrammatic number.
 * Return TRUE if the number is strobogrammatic or FALSE if it is not.
 * <p>
 * Note: A strobogrammatic number appears the same when rotated 180 degrees (viewed upside down).
 * For example, “69” is strobogrammatic because it looks the same when flipped upside down, while “962” is not.
 *
 * eg: 808 true
