/**
 * Implement atoi which converts a string to an integer.
 * <p>
 * The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found.
 * Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible,
 * and interprets them as a numerical value.
 * <p>
 * The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the
 * behavior of this function.
 * <p>
 * If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because
 * either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.
 * <p>
 * If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned.
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * <p>
 * Only the space character ' ' is considered as whitespace character.
 * Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range:
 * [−231,  231 − 1]. If the numerical value is out of the range of representable values, INT_MAX (231 − 1) or INT_MIN (−231) is returned.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: "42"
 * Output: 42
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: "   -42"
 * Output: -42
 * Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is '-', which is the minus sign.
 * Then take as many numerical digits as possible, which gets 42.
 * <p>
 * Example 3:
 * <p>
 * Input: "4193 with words"
 * Output: 4193
 * Explanation: Conversion stops at digit '3' as the next character is not a numerical digit.
 * <p>
 * Example 4:
 * <p>
 * Input: "words and 987"
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is 'w', which is not a numerical
 * digit or a +/- sign. Therefore no valid conversion could be performed.
 * <p>
 * Example 5:
 * <p>
 * Input: "-91283472332"
 * Output: -2147483648
 * Explanation: The number "-91283472332" is out of the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
 * Thefore INT_MIN (−231) is returned.
