/**
 * Given a string s consisting of only opening and closing brackets '(' and ')', find out the minimum number of
 * reversals required to convert the string into a balanced expression.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * If it is not possible to make the brackets balanced, return -1. A reversal means changing '(' to ')' or vice-versa.
 * Examples:
 * <p>
 * Input: s = ")(())((("
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Output: 3
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Explanation: One way to balance is:
 * <p>
 * "((())())". There is no balanced sequence
 * <p>
 * that can be formed in lesser reversals.
 * <p>
 * Input: s = "(()((()(())(("
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Output: -1
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Explanation: There's no way we can balance
 * <p>
 * this sequence of braces.
