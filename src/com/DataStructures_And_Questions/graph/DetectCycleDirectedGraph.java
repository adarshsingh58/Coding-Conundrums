/**
 * Given a directed graph, check whether the graph contains a cycle and return a boolean value accordingly.
 * <p>
 * A cycle occurs when you can start at one vertex, follow a path through the edges, and return to the starting vertex. This means at least one vertex is visited more than once within the same traversal path.
 * <p>
 * Note: Edges list is interpreted in the following manner:
 * <p>
 * edges = [[0, 2, 1], [], [2, 1, 0]]
 * <p>
 * Interpretation:
 * <p>
 * 0:0,2,10:0,2,1
 * 1:1: None
 * 2:2,1,02:2,1,0
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * If n is the number of nodes in the graph.
 * <p>
 * n ==edges.length==edges.length
 * 0≤0≤ n ≤100≤100
 * 00 ≤≤ edges[i] ≤≤ nn
