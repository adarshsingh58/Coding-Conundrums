 * Given a directed graph as input, determine a mother vertex within it. A mother vertex in a graph G=(V,E)G=(V,E),
 * is vertex VV such that all other vertices in GG can be reached by a path from VV.
 * Although a graph might feature multiple mother vertices, your goal is to identify at least one.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *     0≤0≤ graph.length ≤104≤104
 *
 *     0≤V,E≤1030≤V,E≤103
 *
 *     V≠EV=E
 *
 *     There are no repeated edges.
