 * Given an integer array temps representing daily temperatures, write a function to calculate the number of days one has to wait for a warmer temperature after each given day. The function should return an array answer where answer[i] represents the wait time for a warmer day after the ith day. If no warmer day is expected in the future, set answer[i] to 0.
 * EXAMPLES
 *
 * Inputs:
