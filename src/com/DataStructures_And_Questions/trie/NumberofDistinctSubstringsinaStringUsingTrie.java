/**
 * oblem Statement: Implement a program that takes a string 'S' as input and returns the number of distinct substrings
 * of the given string, including the empty substring. Use a trie data structure to accomplish this.
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * <p>
 * A string ‘B’ is considered a substring of a string ‘A’ if ‘B’ can be obtained by deleting zero or more characters
 * from the start and end of ‘A’. Two strings ‘X’ and ‘Y’ are considered different if there is at least one index ‘i’
 * such that the character of ‘X’ at index ‘i’ is different from the character of ‘Y’ at index ‘i’ (i.e., X[i] != Y[i]).
 * Example 1: Input: Input String = [‘abab’] Output: 8 Explanation: All possible substring of ‘abab’ are: “” “a” “b”
 * “ab” “aba” “abab” “bab” “ba” Example 2: Input: Input String = [“bob”] Output: 7 Explanation:  All possible substring
 * of ‘bob’ are: “” “b” “bo” “bob” “o” “ob” “b”
